<h1>LAB №2. Advanced landing</h1>

<h2>Description: Improve a landing page following the given design (same as previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.</h2>
<h3>Requirements:</h3>

●	The website should be partly responsive: 
Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens). 
Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.

●	The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens

●	The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).

●	Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS can’t be in just one-two files)

●	All of the previous work requirements must be kept.
